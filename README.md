# youtube-tools

\--- Task 1 ---
---------------------------------------

Write a script that monitors YouTube by searching for a specific keyword and outputs results to the console. Script output should be sent to the Slack channel by using a webhook.

\--- Task 2 ---
---------------------------------------

Create a simple website where you can provide one or more YouTube video Idâ€™s and fetch last 20 comments from each of these videos. Fetched information should be stored in the database, so if a user provides the same video id in a period of 24h then information should be fetched from the database, not from YouTube API.
Information about comments should be parsed and provided in the website page. If information was fetched from the database then additional message should be displayed that information is fetched not from YouTube API.
